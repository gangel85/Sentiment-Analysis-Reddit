Sentiment Analysis on Reddit: learning about GMAT exam complaints. 

I was interested in understanding the limitations, and challenges of the GMAT exam by analyzing comments on the dedicated sub-Reddit forum.
I have performed an analysis by "Web scraping" the posts of Reddit and using sentiment analysis to identify neutral and negatives comments and obtaing word clouds.

The analysis has been performed during a weekend and therefore is not a comprenshive study. However it was sufficient to obtain usefull information. Based on the comments, I have discovered that third party companies produce better studying material than GMAC. Many users complain about the compatibility of the  online "at home" version of the exam with their laptop.

Findings and methods are summarized in the PDF "GMAT_SA.pdf".
