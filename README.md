# Sentiment-Analysis-Reddit
Sentiment Analysis on Reddit , a case study for GMAC.

I was interested in understand the limitations, challenges and limits of the GMAT exam by analyzing the comments of user on Reddit.
I have performed an analysis by "Web scraping" the posts of Reddit and using sentiment analysis to identify negative comments.

I have then looked at the word clouds of such comments to identify important information.

Findings are summarized in the PDF "GMAT_SA.pdf" .
