# Sentiment-Analysis-Reddit
Sentiment Analysis on Reddit , a case study for GMAC.

I was interested in understanding the limitations, challenges and limits of the GMAT exam by analyzing the negative comments of user on Reddit.
I have performed an analysis by "Web scraping" the posts of Reddit and using sentiment analysis to identify negative comments and obtaing word clouds.
I have then looked at the word clouds of such comments to identify important information.

The analysis has been performed during a weekend and therefore is not a comprenshive study.

Findings and methods are summarized in the PDF "GMAT_SA.pdf". 

Based on the comments I have discovered that third party companies produces better studying material than GMAC, as well as a lot of complaints regarding the online "at home" version of the exam with regard glitches and issues with some laptops.
